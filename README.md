A cross-platform tool for monitoring and restricting HTTP/HTTPS requests from processes using network isolation and transparent proxy interception.

Install:

```bash
cargo install httpjail
```

Or download a pre-built binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/coder/httpjail/releases).

## Features

> [!WARNING]
> httpjail is experimental and offers no API or CLI compatibility guarantees.

- 🔒 **Process-level network isolation** - Isolate processes in restricted network environments
- 🌐 **HTTP/HTTPS interception** - Transparent proxy with TLS certificate injection
- 🛡️ **DNS exfiltration protection** - Prevents data leakage through DNS queries
- 🔧 **Multiple evaluation approaches** - JS expressions or custom programs
- 🏢 **Upstream proxy support** - Chain httpjail's egress through a corporate proxy
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform** - Native support for Linux and macOS

## Quick Start

> By default, httpjail denies all network requests. Provide a JS rule or script to allow traffic.

```bash
# Allow only requests to github.com (JS)
httpjail --js "r.host === 'github.com'" -- your-app

# Load JS from a file (auto-reloads on file changes)
echo "/^api\\.example\\.com$/.test(r.host) && r.method === 'GET'" > rules.js
httpjail --js-file rules.js -- curl https://api.example.com/health
# File changes are detected and reloaded automatically on each request

# Log requests to a file
httpjail --request-log requests.log --js "true" -- npm install
# Log format: "<timestamp> <+/-> <METHOD> <URL>" (+ = allowed, - = blocked)

# Use shell script for request evaluation (process per request)
httpjail --sh "/path/to/script.sh" -- ./my-app
# Script receives env vars: HTTPJAIL_URL, HTTPJAIL_METHOD, HTTPJAIL_HOST, etc.
# Exit code 0 allows, non-zero blocks

# Use line processor for request evaluation (efficient persistent process)
httpjail --proc /path/to/filter.py -- ./my-app
# Program receives JSON on stdin (one per line) and outputs allow/deny decisions
# stdin  -> {"method": "GET", "url": "https://api.github.com", "host": "api.github.com", ...}
# stdout -> true

# Run as standalone proxy server (no command execution) and allow all
httpjail --server --js "true"
# Server defaults to ports 8080 (HTTP) and 8443 (HTTPS)
# Configure your application:
# HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8080 HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8443

# Run Docker containers with network isolation (Linux only)
httpjail --js "r.host === 'api.github.com'" --docker-run -- --rm alpine:latest wget -qO- https://api.github.com

# Route httpjail's own egress through an upstream (corporate) proxy
httpjail --upstream-proxy http://proxy.corp:3128 --js "true" -- curl https://api.github.com
# Credentials and HTTPS proxies are supported: http://user:pass@proxy.corp:3128, https://proxy.corp:8443
# May also be set via the HTTPJAIL_UPSTREAM_PROXY environment variable
```

### Upstream (corporate) proxy

When httpjail itself runs in an environment with no direct internet access, use
`--upstream-proxy <URL>` (or the `HTTPJAIL_UPSTREAM_PROXY` environment variable)
to route httpjail's outbound requests through an upstream proxy. Rule evaluation
still happens locally on the intercepted traffic; only the re-originated request
is forwarded through the proxy.

- `http://`, `https://` and bare `host:port` (http assumed) forms are accepted.
- Basic authentication is supported via `http://user:pass@host:port`.
- HTTPS destinations are reached via a `CONNECT` tunnel through the proxy, while
  plain HTTP destinations are forwarded in absolute-form.
- This is independent of the `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` variables that httpjail
  sets *inside* the jail to point sandboxed processes at itself.
