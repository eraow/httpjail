# Configuration

httpjail's behavior can be configured through command-line options, environment variables, and configuration files. This page provides an overview of how these work together.

## Configuration Hierarchy

httpjail follows a simple configuration hierarchy:

1. **Command-line options** - Highest priority, override everything
2. **Environment variables** - Configure httpjail and the jailed process

## Key Configuration Areas

### Rule Engine Selection

Choose how requests are evaluated:

- **JavaScript** (`--js` or `--js-file`) - Fast, sandboxed evaluation
  - Files specified with `--js-file` are automatically reloaded when changed
- **Shell Script** (`--sh`) - System integration, external tools
- **Line Processor** (`--proc`) - Stateful, streaming evaluation

Only one rule engine can be active at a time. See [Rule Engines](./rule-engines/index.md) for detailed comparison.

### Network Mode

Control the isolation level:

- **Strong mode** (default on Linux) - Full network namespace isolation
- **Weak mode** (`--weak`) - Environment variables only, no isolation
- **Server mode** (`--server`) - Run as standalone proxy server

### Logging and Monitoring

Track what's happening:

- **Request logging** (`--request-log`) - Log all HTTP requests
- **Debug output** (`RUST_LOG=debug`) - Detailed operational logs
- **Process output** - Captured from the jailed command

See [Request Logging](./request-logging.md) for details.

## Common Configurations

### Development Environment

```bash
# Allow localhost and common dev services
httpjail --js "['localhost', '127.0.0.1'].includes(r.host)" \
         --request-log /dev/stdout \
         -- npm run dev
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

```bash
# Strict allow-list for builds
httpjail --js-file ci-rules.js \
         --request-log build-network.log \
         --timeout 600 \
         -- make build
```

### Production Service

```bash
# Stateful filtering with monitoring
httpjail --proc ./rate-limiter.py \
         --request-log /var/log/httpjail/requests.log \
         -- ./api-server
```

## Environment Variables

### Set for the jailed process

These are set in the jailed process where applicable. In weak mode, httpjail
sets proxy variables so applications talk to httpjail. On Linux strong mode,
traffic is redirected transparently without setting proxy variables.

| Variable        | Description                  | Example                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `HTTP_PROXY`    | HTTP proxy address           | `http://127.0.0.1:34567` |
| `HTTPS_PROXY`   | HTTPS proxy address          | `http://127.0.0.1:34567` |
| `SSL_CERT_FILE` | CA certificate path          | `/tmp/httpjail-ca.pem`   |
| `SSL_CERT_DIR`  | CA certificate directory     | `/tmp/httpjail-certs/`   |
| `NO_PROXY`      | Bypass proxy for these hosts | `localhost,127.0.0.1`    |

### Consumed by httpjail

These affect httpjail's behavior:

| Variable                 | Description                            | Example                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `RUST_LOG`               | Logging level                          | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `HTTPJAIL_CA_CERT`       | Custom CA certificate path             | `/etc/pki/custom-ca.pem`         |
| `HTTP_PROXY`             | Upstream proxy for httpjail HTTP egress | `http://proxy.corp:3128`        |
| `HTTPS_PROXY`            | Upstream proxy for httpjail HTTPS egress | `http://proxy.corp:3128`       |
| `NO_PROXY`               | Destinations httpjail contacts directly | `internal.corp,10.0.0.0/8`      |

`NO_PROXY` appears in both tables and means two different things. In the table
above it is what httpjail *sets* for the jailed process, so that the process does
not send its localhost traffic to httpjail. Here it is what httpjail *reads* for
its own egress, to decide which destinations to reach without the upstream proxy.
The value you set is used only for httpjail's own egress; it is not passed on to
the jailed process, which would let that process bypass httpjail entirely.

See [Upstream Proxy](../advanced/upstream-proxy.md) for details.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Linux

- Uses network namespaces for strong isolation
- Requires root/sudo for namespace operations
- iptables rules for traffic redirection
- Supports all network modes

### macOS

- Limited to weak mode (environment variables)
- No root required for standard operation
- Certificate trust via Keychain Access
- Some apps may ignore proxy variables

See [Platform Support](./platform-support.md) for detailed information.

## Troubleshooting Configuration

### Rules not matching

```bash
# Debug rule evaluation
RUST_LOG=debug httpjail --js "r.host === 'example.com'" -- curl https://example.com

# Log all requests to see what's being evaluated
httpjail --request-log /dev/stderr --js "false" -- your-app
```

### Environment variables not working

```bash
# Check what's set in the jail
httpjail --js "true" -- env | grep -E "(HTTP|PROXY|SSL)"

# Verify proxy is listening
httpjail --js "true" -- curl -I http://127.0.0.1:$PROXY_PORT
```

### Certificate issues

```bash
# Trust the CA certificate
httpjail trust --install

# Check certificate details
openssl x509 -in ~/.config/httpjail/ca-cert.pem -text -noout
```
